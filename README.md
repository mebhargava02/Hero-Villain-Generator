# Hero-Villain-Generator

I used 3 functions in the program:
  def generate_character():
    This defines the character that the user wants to input. Asks the user for the first name, last name, and the species, and then randomizes the characteristics and the weaknesses. 
  def save_character(character):
    This asks the user if they want to save the randomized character to a txt file.
  def main():
    This acts as the starting point of execution for any software program.
 
While working on this project, I read all the steps one by one and listed down everything in smaller steps so I can finish tasks one by one. but I also read the prompt around 10 times to always see the bigger picture and see the prompt as a whole. I tried to do whatever I could in as much time as I could give the class. 

During the development of the code, there were times when I wanted to give up because either the code wasn't generating random heroes or villains, or it was giving me errors when I was doing the right thing... or at least I thought so. My code was extremely long, so it was a challenge for me make it as efficient as I could. 

**Links I used:**

https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-random-choice-sample-choices/

https://pynative.com/python-random-choice/

The strength of the program is that it does everthing the prompt asks for but there things it misses. It misses spelling checks and everything it needs to be more efficient. I would add this feature to improve the program.
